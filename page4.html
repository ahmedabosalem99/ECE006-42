    <h1>HISTORY OF AI</h1>
    <p>Intelligent robots and artificial beings appeared first in Ancient Greek myths. The invention of syllogism by Aristotle, and the use of deductive reasoning, was a crucial moment in the quest of mankind to understand their own intellect. Although the origins are long and wide, the past of artificial intelligence spans less than a century, as we think about it today. Below is a short look at some of the most important events in AI. </p>
