    <h1>HOW IS AI USED?</h1>
    In general, artificial intelligence falls into two broad categories:
    <p><b> Narrow AI:</b> This kind of artificial intelligence, often referred to as "poor AI," works within a restricted context, and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is always extremely well focused on performing a single task and although these devices can seem smart, they work under much more restrictions and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. </p>
    <p><b>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</b>AGI, also referred to as "Solid AI," is the type of artificial intelligence that we see in the movies, like Westworld robots or Star Trek 's Data: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and can apply that intelligence to solve any problem, much like a human being.</p>
    <b>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLES</b>
    <p>*Smart assistants (like Siri and Alexa)</p>
    <p>*Disease mapping and prediction tools</p>
    <p>*Manufacturing and drone robots</p>
    <p>*Optimized, personalized healthcare treatment recommendations</p>
    <p>*Conversational bots for marketing and customer service</p>
    <p>*Robo-advisors for stock trading</p>
    <p>*Song or TV show recommendations from Spotify and Netflix</p>
    <p>*Spam filters on email</p>
    <p>*Social media monitoring tools for dangerous content or false news</p>
    <b>Narrow Artificial Intelligence:</b>
    <p>Narrow AI is all around us, and is probably the most effective artificial intelligence realization to date. In the last decade, Narrow AI has undergone several breakthroughs that have had "important social benefits and added to the nation's economic growth," according to "Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence," a 2016 report released by the Obama Administration.A few examples of Narrow AI include: 

        <b>Google search</b>- 
        <b>Image recognition software</b>-
        <b>Siri, Alexa and other personal assistants</b>-
        <b>Self-driving cars</b>-
        <b>IBM's Watson</b> </p>
    <b>Machine Learning & Deep Learning:</b>
    <p>Much of Narrow AI's motivated by machine learning breakthroughs and deep learning. It may be difficult to comprehend the difference between artificial intelligence , machine learning, and deep learning. A good overview of how to distinguish between them is provided by the venture capitalist Frank Chen, noting: Artificial intelligence is a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to mimic human intelligence. Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques."Simply put, machine learning feeds a computer data and uses statistical techniques to help it "learn" how to get progressively better at a task, without having been specifically programmed for that task, eliminating the need for millions of lines of written code. Machine learning consists of both supervised learning (using labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning (using unlabeled data sets).AGI has been the inspiration of dystopian science fiction for a long time, in which super-intelligent robots overpower humanity, but experts believe that this is not something we need to think about soon.</p>
    <p><b>Deep learning</b>  is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologically-inspired neural network architecture. The neural networks contain a number of hidden layers through which the data is processed, allowing the machine to go "deep" in its learning, making connections and weighting input for the best results.</p>
<b>Artificial General Intelligence:</b>
<p>For many AI researchers, the development of a computer with human-level intelligence that can be applied to any function is the Holy Grail, but the quest for AGI has been hard-pressed.The quest for a "universal learning and acting algorithm in any context" (Russel and Norvig 27) is not new, but time has not eased the complexity of designing a computer with a full set of cognitive abilities.AGI has been the inspiration of dystopian science fiction for a long time, in which super-intelligent robots overpower humanity, but experts believe that this is not something we need to think about soon.</p>
