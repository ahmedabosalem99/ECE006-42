    <h1>HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORK?</h1>
 <p>Mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?" Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces to win World War II<p>
 <p>The fundamental aim and vision of artificial intelligence was established by Turing 's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and the subsequent Turing Test.<p>
<p><img src="what-is-artificial-intelligence_1.png" alt=""> At its core, AI is the branch of computer science which is aimed at answering Turing 's affirmative question. It's the attempt at replicating or simulating human intelligence in computers.<p> 
 <p>The expansive purpose of artificial intelligence has led to numerous questions and debates. So much so, that there is no universally agreed single field description.</p>
 <p>The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent? Artificial Intelligence: A New Approach in their groundbreaking textbook, writers Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig address the issue by unifying their work around the topic of smart agents in computers. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents obtaining environmental perceptions and performing behavior" (Russel and Norvig viii)</p>
 <p>Norvig and Russell continue their analysis of four different methods that have traditionally described AI: </p>
 <p><b>1.Thinking humanly</b></p>
</p><b>2.Thinking rationally</b></p>
</p><b>3.Acting humanly</b></p>
</p><b>4.Acting rationally</b></p>
 <p>The first two theories are about thought processes and reasoning, while the others are about behaviour. In particular, Norvig and Russell concentrate on rational agents who act to achieve the best result, noting "all the skills necessary for the Turing Test often allow an agent to act rationally" (Russel and Norvig 4). Patrick Winston, MIT's Ford Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, describes AI as "algorithms allowed by constraints, revealed by representations that help loop-focused models that bind together thought, perception and action."</p>
 <p>While the average person may consider these concepts abstract, they help focus the field as an area of computer science and provide a framework for infusing computers and systems with machine learning and other artificial intelligence subsets.When addressing a crowd at the 2017 Japan AI Experience, Jeremy Achin, CEO of DataRobot, started his speech by presenting the following description of how AI is used today: "AI is a computer system capable of performing tasks typically involving human intelligence ... Some of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some are powered by deep learning and some are powered by very boring stuff like rules."</p>
